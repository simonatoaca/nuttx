DRV2605L Haptic Driver
==========================

The DRV2605L Haptic Driver provides vibration effects,
using either an ERM or a LRA actuator. It uses
the **force-feedback** driver model, borrowed from Linux.
The driver has plenty of features, but, for the moment, only
the RTP mode and playing of effects from the device's ROM
are supported.

#. **Configuration**

    In ``menuconfig``, the user should select the pins,
    the actuator used, the preferred mode of operation,
    and, based on that, a library for prebuilt
    effects. More details can be found in the datasheet.

#. **Initialization**

    For the DRV2605L to be used in conjunction with a board, it
    needs to be registered in a file with a name such as ``<chip>_drv2605l.c``
    (e.g. ``esp32s3_drv2605l.c``), placed probably in the ``<board>/src``
    directory.

    For simplicity, the gpios used are initialized before the registering
    of the driver, using the board's specific gpio functions. For now,
    only the EN pin is needed, but in the future, IN might also need
    initialization (IN can be used as an external trigger, or to drive
    pwm/analog inputs to the drv2605l).

    Aside from the needed pins, the I2C bus used for communication also
    needs initialization.

    Lastly, the user can provide calibration parameters to the driver,
    using the ``drv2605l_calib_s`` structure found in
    ``include/nuttx/input/drv2605l.h``. The driver uses default
    values if ``NULL`` is passed in the register call.

    A truncated version of a registering sequence for an esp32s3-based
    board can look like this:

    .. code-block:: c

        i2c = esp32s3_i2cbus_initialize(busno);

        up_mdelay(250);
        esp32s3_configgpio(CONFIG_DRV2605L_EN_PIN, OUTPUT);
        esp32s3_gpiowrite(CONFIG_DRV2605L_EN_PIN, true);

        // use default values for calib
        ret = drv2605l_register(devno, i2c, NULL);
        if (ret < 0)
        {
            ierr("ERROR: Error registering DRV2605L in I2C%d\n", busno);
        }

#. **Usage in an app**

    An example of a force-feedback app: ``nuttx-apps/testing/fftest/fftest.c``.
    Effects need to be uploaded to the driver, then they can be played.
    The ``ff_effect`` structure is populated based on what the driver used
    supports and is specific to the implementation. Here are the 2 ways
    an effect can be specified for the drv2605l:

    1. Constant effect (RTP mode)
 
        .. code-block:: c

            effect.type = FF_CONSTANT;
            effect.id = -1;                   /* Driver will assign an id */
            effect.u.constant.level = 0x4000; /* Strength : 50 % */
            effect.replay.length = 1000;      /* Duration (ms) */
            effect.replay.delay = 500;        /* Time to wait after trigger (ms) */
        
        .. code-block:: c

            /* Strength : 25 %, but 
             * - counter-rotation for ERM
             * - 180 degree shift in phase for LRA
             */
            effect.u.constant.level = -0x2000;


    2. Periodic, custom effect (ROM library effect)

        Expected custom_data field:
        [effect_id, wait_time,  ...., wait_time, effect_id, wait_time]
        with a maximum of 8 non-zero fields
        (wait_time = 0 => not written to any registers).
        Maximum custom_len is 16 (8 pairs of wait time and id).

        Single effect:

        .. code-block:: c

            effect.type = FF_PERIODIC;
            effect.id = -1;
            effect.u.periodic.waveform = FF_CUSTOM;
            effect.u.periodic.custom_len = 1;      /* max 16 */
            effect.u.periodic.custom_data =
                calloc(effect.u.periodic.custom_len, sizeof(int16_t));
            effect.u.periodic.custom_data[0] = 47; /* ROM effect 47 */
            effect.replay.delay = 1000;            /* Time to wait after trigger (ms) */


        Multiple effects, with a wait time between them:

        .. code-block:: c

            effect.u.periodic.custom_len = 3;       /* max 16 */
            effect.u.periodic.custom_data =
                calloc(effect.u.periodic.custom_len, sizeof(int16_t));
            effect.u.periodic.custom_data[0] = 120; /* ROM effect 47 */
            effect.u.periodic.custom_data[1] = 200; /* Wait time of 200 ms */
            effect.u.periodic.custom_data[2] = 41;  /* ROM effect 41 */
